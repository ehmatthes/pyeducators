Overview
---

The Python Education Summit started in 2012 as a simple event. It was an open invitation to anyone who was working in an area where Python and Education overlap. That was enough for the first few years; it brought visibility to a large number of projects, and started to build a core group of people who came to the summit frequently over the first 6 years.

It feels like it's time for the Python Education Summit to evolve from an event into a group, or an organization. What if we became a group like PyLadies? When I think of PyLadies, I think of a group dedicated to supporting women in Python. But I also think of the resources they have curated, and the events they host. Forming a group, with a clear mission, can expand our reach and drive what the Education Summit evolves into.

What, specifically?
---

- Is there consensus that this is the right next step?
- Draft a mission/ purpose statement.
- Define our platform.
- Build a website to communicate the platform.
- Use the new group and its mission to drive what the Education Summit evolves into for PyCon 2019.
- Define a baseline communication structure.
